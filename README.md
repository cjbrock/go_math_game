# Math Addition Game (GO)
## Iteration 1: 

Simple addition game to be played in your terminal that will load in a CSV and ask a set number of addition questions. Will track correct/incorrect answers and output the answers at the end.

## Iteration 2
Adds a timer function that defaults to 30 seconds but takes an optional flag in seconds. Will immediately exit on timeout and output the results.
